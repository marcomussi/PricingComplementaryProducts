class OptIndepPricingAgent:
    """
    An agent for solving an independent product pricing problem.
    This agent uses a Improved Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (IGP-UCB)
    bandit to find the optimal margin (price) for a single product.
    The agent doesn't model the objective function directly. Instead, it
    models the demand probability as a function of the margin.
    It uses an `IGPUCB` agent for this, which assumes the demand observations
    are noisy (following a Bernoulli/Binomial distribution).
